Software package to predict the outcomes of NHL games

1. Make sure scores files are present
   i.e. a local scores/ directory with the following files inside:
   	2005-2006.scores, 2006-2007.scores, etc.

2. Run database.py (only once)
   - this will drop any previous database named hockey and create a new one
   - a new table will be created for every .scores file (every season)
   - 1900-1901 is a fake season for testing purposes (smaller dataset)
   - for each table created, it will be populated with data from the
     .scores files (open one and take a look)
   - play around in the MySQL terminal after running database.py and see
     what it created

##============================================================##
## At this point the raw data has all been imported into the  ##
## MySQL database database.py should not need to be run again ##
## unless to start from a clean slate                         ##
##============================================================##

3. That is all so far...
